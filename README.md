### Metervara Splash Covers

Short collection of splash/cover experiments.

- **Published covers**: Numeric folders under `src/` (e.g. `src/1`, `src/2`). They are auto-listed, available at `/<number>/`, and included in builds/manifest.
- **Unpublished/WIP covers**: Any non-numeric folder name (e.g. `src/_clock_circles`). They are ignored by the manifest and builds. In dev, preview via `/src/<folder-name>/` (e.g. `/src/_clock_circles/`).
- **Publish a WIP**: Rename the folder to the next number (e.g. `src/9/`). It will be picked up automatically.
